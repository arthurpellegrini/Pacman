Pac-Man Project
==============================================================

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, this game has been realized in binomial as part of our first programming tutorial project of our first year of DUT Computer Science at the IUT of VÃ©lizy.
The game is coded in C language and uses the SDL_2 library.
Although the name of the project is reminiscent of the game Pac-Man, our version does not have the same features as the original game.

##### What is Pac-Man? 

* Pac-Man is an old game, in which we control Pac-Man, a yellow ball that has to eat all the gum in a level to move on to the next level
* But 4 ghosts (Blinky, Clyde, Inky and Pinky) are there to make you lose
* Pac-Man has three lives, if you touch him, he loses one of his lives
* That's why Pac-Man can eat one of the four Pac-gummies present on the level, these freeze the ghosts for a few seconds

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the steps to follow in order to test our game. 
The game is executable on a linux system by following these steps, but it is important to specify that it is also executable on another type of system with some manipulations to install the C language and the SDL_2 library.

##### First step

You must download the pacman folder. For that click on the Github logo below.

Then go to the green "code" button and select "download zip".

##### Second step

Now you have to extract the source code from the compressed folder. To do this, run the following command in the terminal: 
 ```sh
 $ unzip Downloads/pacman.zip -d Downloads/pacman
 ```

##### Third step

Finally, you will need to run this command in a terminal to start the game: 

```sh
$ bash Downloads/pacman/script_pacman.sh
```

Now the game should have started, all you have to do is play!

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you launch the game, you have to press the space key to start a game, and then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play.
